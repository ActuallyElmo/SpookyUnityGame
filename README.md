# Not Alone Here

**Not Alone Here** is a *First-Person Survival Horror* game, inspired by titles like *Granny*. The player explores a house, must avoid a dangerous monster, find hidden items, and solve puzzles to escape.  

The main door is blocked by wooden planks, a padlock, and a numeric keypad, and each obstacle must be overcome using the objects found and the player's logic. The game combines exploration, survival, and stealth elements, creating a tense and engaging experience.  

The ultimate goal is to survive and escape the house without being caught by the enemy.
